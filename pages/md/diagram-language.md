One of my primary goals with LVCA is to build a productive, shareable environment for math and computer science. Two of the first pieces that we'll need are tools for documents and for diagrams. It's my goal here to start to explore diagrams.

We'll look at our needs, prior work on languages for diagrams, and finally the beginnings of a language for writing diagrams.
